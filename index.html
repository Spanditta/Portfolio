            My Favourite Hobby
            <br>
            Reading Books
        </h1>
        <br>

        <p> My favoutite hobby is reading books. I am Spanditta and I study in 6th Standard. I love all kinds of books, such as mystery, magic, fantasy, etc. Reading books gives you wings of creativity. One naturally develops this habit when he/she reads a good book. Books are not only for reading, they give us knoledge about things that have happened in the past long ago, morals and many more things.Some people also choose their books according to their favourite author. My favourite authors are Sudha Murthy, Enid Blyton and JK.Rowling. Sudha Murthy is a famous Indian author who is also the founder and chairman of the Infosys Foundation. This company provides technology resources to people and also participates in helping poor and needy people. Before becoming the founder and chaiman of this company, she was a teacher in a government school in Karnataka. She always believes in eaquality between boys and girls and sometimes a teacher can learn from a student too. In her books, she tells some heartwarming stories about her life and morals she learnt from them. She also writes funny stories with morals and also some myths that are worth reading. JK.Rowling is a famous author who wrote the Hary Potter series. Her imagination can never let us down. She has recently published a new book called "The Fantastic Beasts and where to find them". Her books are enjoyble and fun to read. Enid Blyton's books are filled with fantasy imagination and creativity. Recently, I read her famous book, "The Enchanted Woods". It was worth reading. I hope you like reading my recommendations. </p>
